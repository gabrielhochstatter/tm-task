# Submission Notes:

- For the sake of time, I've tried to make this as simple as possible, so I've left some of the fancier bits of form validation (inline as you type etc) out.
- I've included unit tests for one component (`WaitingListForm`) to demonstrate how I'd approach testing a component like that. Again for the sake of time I didn't write tests for every component.
- Again for the sake of time I've skipped doing this in Typescript.
